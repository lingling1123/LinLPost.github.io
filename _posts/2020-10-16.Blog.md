In Project2, I use bike share dataset to fit a classification tree model and a boosted tree model for predicting cnt variable.
After reading in data, I split dataset into training,test. And, I centered, scaled dataset and then fit it to two models.
If I start over, I wouldn’t spend time on combining these two dataset since hour is a detail version of day. It’s meningless to conbine these two consideiring that combinded version is hour itself. The most diffuclt part is automation. I spend some time on learing it. The big idea I learned from this project is also automating process, which is easier than rewriting similar code and it’s more efficient.
