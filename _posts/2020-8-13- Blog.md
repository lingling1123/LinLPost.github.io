For me, data scientists lay a solid data foundation in order to perform robust analytics and then make a decision on products. Basic skills as machine learning,tests are invovled. I believe that soild knowledge in statistics is neccessay for both data scientist and statisticians while prograinmg skill is a plus for data scientist.  Since I already have basic knowlege in statistics, I will be confident to treat myself as a data scientist after I gain more experience in this class.
