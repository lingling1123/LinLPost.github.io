Through one semester's study, my thought in becoming a data scientist changes in somneway. A great coding ability is requreid and it plays a critical role. 
Data scientists apply data they have to do some manipulations and get results based on output from software, then do statiscial analysis based on results and offer professional
advices for others. So, professional knowledge in statistics and strong coding ablitiy are both important and necessary.
After using R for a sesmeter, I think I will comtinues to use R since it's more convenient. It has more flexible syntax and it does not need to create lots of dataset compared to SAS.
So, considering it's advantages, I will continue to use R. 
This class covers lots of things including machine learning, visualization, APP creation, and so on., which improves my ablitiy in R.  For example, I can make graphs now using functions inside ggplot2 library
other than plot function I used before. Meanwhile, I can make non-linear tree model predictions compared to linear model I knew before.  
I will continue to do pratices in R, and I wish to be a good data statistist in future.
