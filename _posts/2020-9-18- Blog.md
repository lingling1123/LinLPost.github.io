In this project, I contact APIs to get various data, and then apply functions to data.Use informations I get to analysis and draw graphs.
For this project, Printing dataset inside dataset is really chllanging me. I sepnd lots of times on it. Logic part is fine. But experiences is not good. 
Language doesn't do waht I think. Debug is a really big problem to me. For next project, I hope I can imporve my debug ability and make my project nice and clear.
