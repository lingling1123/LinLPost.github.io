### Experience

I had programming experience in SAS. I think that R is more easier to use than SAS because of syntax. I do like R considering that it provides lots of build-in packages and library like dplyr that can do analysis easily. However, SAS do better at handling data. Both language are good to use. Based on personal experience, I don't believe that r is a diffcuclt language to learn.
